## Introduction to Python Libraries
Python libraries are collections of pre-written code that extend the functionality of the Python programming language. They provide developers with a wide range of tools and functionalities to solve various problems and automate tasks. In this article, we will explore what a Python library is, how to install and import a library, and provide some examples of popular libraries like math, random, and datetime.

## What is a Python Library?
A Python library is a module that contains a collection of functions, classes, and other code that can be used to extend the functionality of the Python programming language. Libraries are typically written in Python and can be installed using the Python package manager, pip. They can be imported into a Python script or program to use their functions and features.

## Installing and using a library
Importing a library is a simple process. First, you need to install the library using pip. For example, to install the math library, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

import math


Use pip install to get the library. Then, you can import the library in your Python script or program using the following syntax:
